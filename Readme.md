# OSX-Tools

## Productivity tools and configurations for OS X

### Window Manager
Currently using the following:
* Karabiner
** https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/
* Seil
** https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en
* Hammerspoon
** http://www.hammerspoon.org/

Using the above tools, as many have, I have mapped my Caps Lock key as a 'hyper' key that simulates pressing 'shift,ctl,alt,cmd' at the same time.  I have then defined functional sequences (hyper + <key>) to manage windows and focus/open applicaions.  For now this is a very basic setup but a good starting point to understand exactly how each component works with the other and must be configured.
